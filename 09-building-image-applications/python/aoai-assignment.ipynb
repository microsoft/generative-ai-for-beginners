    "# Building an Image Generation Application \n",
    "\n",
    "There's more to LLMs than text generation. It's also possible to generate images from text descriptions. Having images as a modality can be highly useful in a number of areas from MedTech, architecture, tourism, game development and more. In this chapter, we will look into the two most popular image generation models, DALL-E and Midjourney.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image generation and why it's useful.\n",
    "- DALL-E and Midjourney, what they are, and how they work.\n",
    "- How you would build an image generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an image generation application.\n",
    "- Define boundaries for your application with meta prompts. \n",
    "- Work with DALL-E and Midjourney.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why build an image generation application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image generation applications are a great way to explore the capabilities of Generative AI. They can be used for, for example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image editing and synthesis**. You can generate images for a variety of use cases, such as image editing and image synthesis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applied to a variety of industries**. They can also be used to generate images for a variety of industries like Medtech, Tourism, Game development and more. \n",

    "## Scenario: Edu4All \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this lesson, we will continue to work with our startup, Edu4All, in this lesson. The students will create images for their assessments, exactly what images is up to the students, but they could be illustrations for their own fairytale or create a new character for their story or help them visualize their ideas and concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what Edu4All's students could generate for example if they're working in class on monuments:\n",

    "\n",
    "[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) are two of the most popular image generation models, they allow you to use prompts to generate images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DALL-E\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with DALL-E, which is a Generative AI model that generates images from text descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [DALL-E is a combination of two models, CLIP and diffused attention](https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-dall-e-and-clip-101-a-brief-introduction-3a4367280d4e?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **CLIP**, is a model that generates embeddings, which are numerical representations of data, from images and text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diffused attention**, is a model that generates images from embeddings. DALL-E is trained on a dataset of images and text and can be used to generate images from text descriptions. For example, DALL-E can be used to generate images of a cat in a hat, or a dog with a mohawk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Midjourney\n",
    " \n",
    "Midjourney works in a similar way to DALL-E, it generates images from text prompts. Midjourney, can also be used to generate images using prompts like “a cat in a hat”, or a “dog with a mohawk”. \n",

    "First, [DALL-E](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12092.pdf?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst). DALL-E is a Generative AI model based on the transformer architecture with an *autoregressive transformer*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An *autoregressive transformer* defines how a model generates images from text descriptions, it generates one pixel at a time, and then uses the generated pixels to generate the next pixel. Passing through multiple layers in a neural network, until the image is complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this process, DALL-E, controls attributes, objects, characteristics, and more in the image it generates. However, DALL-E 2 and 3 have more control over the generated image, "

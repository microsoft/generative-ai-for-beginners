      "I'm sorry to hear you're having stomach pain. As a surgeon, you know that \"stomach pain\" is a broad complaint with a wide differential diagnosis, ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. Without a physical examination, history, or further diagnostics, it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis, but I can help outline a general approach and possible causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Aspects to Assess:\n",
      "- **Location** (epigastric, periumbilical, lower quadrants, generalized?)\n",
      "- **Onset & Duration**\n",
      "- **Character** (sharp, dull, crampy, constant, intermittent?)\n",
      "- **Associated symptoms** (nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, obstipation, weight loss, GI bleeding)\n",
      "- **Aggravating/relieving factors**\n",
      "- **Past medical/surgical history** (especially prior abdominal operations)\n",
      "- **Medications**, alcohol/drug use\n",
      "\n",
      "### Differential Diagnosis Highlights\n",
      "- **Acute abdomen** (appendicitis, cholecystitis, perforated ulcer, bowel obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, pancreatitis)\n",
      "- **Non-surgical** causes: gastroenteritis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, IBS, urinary tract infection, gynecologic pathology (in females), constipation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Red Flags\n",
      "Immediate evaluation is needed if:  \n",
      "- Severe, sudden-onset (\"worst ever\") pain  \n",
      "- Signs of peritonitis (rigidity, rebound, involuntary guarding)  \n",
      "- Hemodynamic instability (shock)  \n",
      "- GI bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia)  \n",
      "- Persistent vomiting, high fever  \n",
      "\n",
      "### What to do?\n",
      "If you are the patient:\n",
      "- Monitor for severe symptoms/red flags as above  \n",
      "- If pain is mild, keep NPO and observe, with symptom logging  \n",
      "- If moderate/severe, especially with red flag signs, **seek urgent clinical evaluation**  \n",
      "- Laboratory and imaging as appropriate (CBC, BMP, LFTs, lipase/amylase, urinalysis, pregnancy test if female, abdominal X-ray/CT/US as indicated)\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**This does not replace a formal medical evaluation.** If there's any *concern for a surgical emergency,* seek immediate medical/surgical consultation.\n",

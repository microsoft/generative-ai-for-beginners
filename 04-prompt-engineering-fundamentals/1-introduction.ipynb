It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

People have known about Jupiter for a really long time because it is very bright in the night sky. It is named after a god from ancient Rome. Sometimes, Jupiter is so bright that it can make shadows on Earth. It is usually the third-brightest thing we can see at night, after the Moon and Venus.\n"

# Function Calling Extended: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Resources

This directory contains educational resources that extend the core function calling lesson with advanced concepts around the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and unified AI assistant management.

## üìö Available Resources

### [Model Context Protocol Guide](./model-context-protocol-guide.md?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

A comprehensive educational guide that builds on the function calling concepts from the main lesson to introduce:

- **MCP Fundamentals**: How MCP extends function calling to work with multiple AI assistants
- **Educational Use Cases**: Practical scenarios for learning and teaching with multiple AI tools
- **Roundtable MCP Server**: Hands-on experience with unified AI assistant management
- **IDE Integration**: Setting up MCP in popular educational development environments
- **Learning Projects**: Step-by-step examples for educational workflows

## üíª Code Examples

### Python Example
- **File**: [`../python/mcp-roundtable-example.py`](../python/mcp-roundtable-example.py?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)
- **Purpose**: Interactive Python demonstration of MCP concepts
- **Features**: Tool discovery, educational scenarios, configuration examples
- **Target**: Students learning Python and AI integration

### TypeScript Example
- **File**: [`../typescript/mcp-roundtable-example.ts`](../typescript/mcp-roundtable-example.ts?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)
- **Purpose**: Web development focused MCP demonstration
- **Features**: Framework integration, React examples, full-stack workflows
- **Target**: Students learning modern web development with AI assistance

## üéØ Educational Objectives

These resources help students understand:

1. **Function Calling Evolution**: How MCP builds upon the function calling concepts learned in the main lesson
2. **Multi-AI Workflows**: Using different AI assistants for different aspects of learning and development
3. **Unified Tool Management**: Benefits of standardized AI assistant integration
4. **Practical Implementation**: Real-world setup and configuration in educational environments
5. **Comparative Learning**: Understanding different AI approaches to the same problems

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Complete the main function calling lesson first
- Basic understanding of AI assistants and API integration
- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+ for running examples

### Quick Start
1. **Read the Guide**: Start with the [Model Context Protocol Guide](./model-context-protocol-guide.md?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)
2. **Install Tools**: Follow installation instructions for Roundtable MCP Server
3. **Try Examples**: Run the Python or TypeScript demonstrations
4. **Experiment**: Set up MCP in your preferred development environment

### Educational Workflow
```bash
# 1. Install the unified AI assistant interface
pip install roundtable-ai

# 2. Check which AI tools are available
roundtable-ai --check

# 3. Run the educational demonstration
python ../python/mcp-roundtable-example.py

# 4. Or try the TypeScript version
npm install -g typescript ts-node
ts-node ../typescript/mcp-roundtable-example.ts
```

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After working through these resources, students will be able to:

- Explain how MCP extends function calling concepts
- Set up unified AI assistant management in their development environment
- Use multiple AI assistants effectively for different learning tasks
- Design educational projects that leverage different AI capabilities

This file will use the official Python image as the base image for the 
development container. It will also install some VS Code extensions for Python development,
such as the Python extension and the Jupyter. 

Finally, it will run the command pip install -r requirements.txt after the container is 
created, which will install all the Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. 
You can learn more about how to create and use dev containers in VS Code from this link or this link. 
I hope this helps you with your project http://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst

    "Prompt engineering na di process wey dem dey use design and optimize prompts for natural language processing tasks. E involve to choose di correct prompts, adjust dia parameters, and check how dem dey perform. Prompt engineering dey very important to get better accuracy and efficiency for NLP models. For dis section, we go look di basics of prompt engineering using OpenAI models for exploration.\n"

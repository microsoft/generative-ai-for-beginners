    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "You don see for dis curriculum say e get core concepts like prompts and even one whole discipline wey dem dey call \"prompt engineering\". Plenty tools wey you fit use like ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform and others, dey support you to use prompts do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to add dis kain experience for app, you go need sabi concepts like prompts, completions and choose one library wey you go use. Na wetin you go learn for dis chapter be dat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For dis chapter, you go:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about the openai library and di main concepts wey dey inside.\n",
    "- Build one text generation app wey dey use openai.\n",
    "- Understand how to use concepts like prompt, temperature, and tokens to build one text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you finish dis lesson, you go fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain wetin text generation app be.\n",
    "- Build one text generation app wey dey use openai.\n",
    "- Configure your app to use more or less tokens and also change di temperature, so di output go dey different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wetin be text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when you dey build app, e go get some kind interface like dis ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps na di kind app wey you go type command and e go do di work. Example na `git`, wey be command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps get graphical user interfaces (GUIs) wey you go fit click buttons, type text, select options and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps get limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare am to command-based app wey you dey type command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **E get limit**. You no fit just type any command, na only di ones wey di app support you fit type.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps dey support plenty languages, but normally di app dey build for one specific language, even if you fit add more language support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how text generation app dey different?\n",
    "\n",
    "For text generation app, you get more freedom, you no dey limited to set of commands or one specific input language. Instead, you fit use natural language interact with di app. Another benefit be say, because you dey interact with one data source wey dem don train with plenty information, traditional app fit dey limited to wetin dey inside di database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wetin I fit build with text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Plenty things dey wey you fit build. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chatbot**. Chatbot wey dey answer questions about topics, like your company and di products fit work well.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs dey good for things like summarizing text, getting insights from text, producing text like CVs and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on di language model wey you dey use, you fit build code assistant wey go help you write code. Example na GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT wey fit help you write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How I go take start?\n",
    "\n",
    "You go need find way to connect with LLM wey usually dey involve dis two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use API. For here, you go dey create web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use library. Libraries dey help make di API calls easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular libraries dey for working with LLMs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**, dis library dey make am easy to connect to your model and send prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then e get libraries wey dey operate for higher level like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain dey popular and e dey support Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel na library wey Microsoft create wey dey support C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app wey dey use openai\n",
    "\n",
    "Make we see how we fit build our first app, wetin we need, how much work e go take and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install openai\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE] Dis step no dey necessary if you dey run dis notebook for Codespaces or inside Devcontainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plenty libraries dey wey you fit use to interact with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. You fit use different programming languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, Java and more.  \n",
    "We don choose to use `openai` Python library, so we go use `pip` install am.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you no dey run dis notebook for Codespaces or Dev Container, you go need install [Python](https://www.python.org/) for your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create resource and find your API key\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never do am before, you go need do dis steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create account for OpenAI <https://platform.openai.com/signup>.\n",
    "- Then, find your API keys <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>. \n",
    "\n",
    ">[!NOTE]\n",
    "> E good make you separate your API key from your code. You fit do am by using environment variables.\n",
    "> - Set di environment variable `OPENAI_KEY` to your API key for your .env file. If you don complete di previous exercises for dis course, you don already set am up.\n",
    "> - E important to note say di API Key go only dey accessible once. So, make sure say you don copy am well. If e no work as e suppose, e better make you delete di key and generate new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup configuration OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "If you dey use OpenAI, na so you go setup configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = OpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For di code above, we dey set di following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api_key`, na your API key wey you go find for OpenAI dashboard.\n",
    "- `deployment`, na di GPT version wey you dey use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> `os.environ` na function wey dey read environment variables. You fit use am read environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate text\n",
    "\n",
    "Di way to generate text na to use `chat.completion` class. Example dey here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Complete the following: Once upon a time there was a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For di code above, we create one completion object and pass di model wey we wan use and di prompt. Then we print di generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat completions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you don see how we dey use `Completion` to generate text. But e get another class wey dem dey call `ChatCompletion` wey dey better for chatbots. Example dey here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = OpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world\"}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We go talk more about dis functionality for another chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - your first text generation app\n",
    "\n",
    "Now wey we don learn how to setup and configure OpenAI service, e don reach time to build your first text generation app. To build your app, follow dis steps:\n"

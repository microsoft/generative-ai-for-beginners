    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of creating and refining prompts for natural language processing tasks. It includes choosing suitable prompts, adjusting their settings, and assessing how well they work. Prompt engineering plays a key role in reaching high levels of accuracy and efficiency with NLP models. In this section, we’ll cover the fundamentals of prompt engineering, using OpenAI models as examples.\n"

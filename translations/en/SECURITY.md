## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin), and [our GitHub organizations](https://opensource.microsoft.com/).

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that fits [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send an email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key; you can download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/pgpkey).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If you donâ€™t, please follow up by email to confirm we received your original message. Additional information is available at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/msrc).

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the potential issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
  * Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration needed to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us prioritize your report more efficiently.

If you are submitting a bug bounty report, more detailed reports can lead to higher rewards. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/bounty) page for more information about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/cvd).

    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this curriculum, you've learned about key concepts like prompts and even a whole field called \"prompt engineering.\" Many tools you use, such as ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and others, let you use prompts to get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add this kind of experience to your own app, you need to understand prompts, completions, and pick a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll cover in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get to know the openai library and its main concepts.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Learn how to use prompts, temperature, and tokens to create a text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what a text generation app is.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Adjust your app to use more or fewer tokens and change the temperature for different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when you build an app, it has some kind of interface like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps are classic examples where you type a command and it does something. For instance, `git` is a command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, enter text, select options, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to a command-based app where you type a command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's limited**. You can't just type anything; only the commands the app supports will work.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps support multiple languages, but usually they're built for one language, even if you can add more later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what makes a text generation app different?\n",
    "\n",
    "With a text generation app, you have more freedom—you're not stuck with a fixed set of commands or a specific input language. You can use natural language to interact with the app. Another advantage is that you're working with a data source trained on a huge amount of information, while a traditional app might only have what's in its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can I build with a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of possibilities. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A chatbot**. You could build a chatbot that answers questions about your company and its products.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs are great for things like summarizing text, finding insights, generating resumes, and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model, you can create a code assistant to help you write code. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need a way to connect to an LLM, which usually means one of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an API. You send web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use a library. Libraries wrap the API calls and make them easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some well-known libraries for working with LLMs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**, which makes it simple to connect to your model and send prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also higher-level libraries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain is popular and works with Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a Microsoft library that supports C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app using GitHub Models Playground and Azure AI Inference SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how to build your first app, what libraries you'll need, and how much work is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GitHub Models?\n",

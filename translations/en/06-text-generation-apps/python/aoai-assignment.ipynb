    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this curriculum, you've learned about key concepts like prompts and even a whole field called \"prompt engineering.\" Many tools you use—like ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and others—let you use prompts to get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add this kind of experience to your own app, you need to understand prompts, completions, and pick a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll learn in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discover the openai library and its main concepts.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Learn how to use prompts, temperature, and tokens to create a text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what a text generation app is.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Adjust your app to use more or fewer tokens and change the temperature for different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when you build an app, it has some kind of interface, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps are typical examples where you type a command and it does something. For instance, `git` is a command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, enter text, choose options, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to a command-based app where you type a command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's limited**. You can't type just anything—only the commands the app supports.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps support multiple languages, but usually they're built for one language, even if you can add more later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how is a text generation app different?\n",
    "\n",
    "With a text generation app, you have more freedom—you're not stuck with a fixed set of commands or a specific input language. Instead, you can use natural language to interact with the app. Another advantage is that you're working with a data source trained on a huge amount of information, while a traditional app might only have what's in its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can I build with a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of possibilities. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A chatbot**. A chatbot that answers questions about topics like your company and its products is a great use case.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs are excellent at summarizing text, finding insights, generating things like resumes, and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model, you can build a code assistant to help you write code. For example, GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can help you with coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need a way to connect to an LLM, which usually means one of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an API. You send web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use a library. Libraries wrap the API calls and make them easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few popular libraries for working with LLMs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**. This library makes it simple to connect to your model and send prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also higher-level libraries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain is well known and supports Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a Microsoft library that supports C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app using openai\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how to build your first app, what libraries you'll need, and what's involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install openai\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE] This step is not necessary if run this notebook on Codespaces or within a Devcontainer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries for working with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI, and you can use several programming languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, and more.  \n",
    "We're going to use the `openai` Python library, so we'll install it with `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not running this notebook in Codespaces or a Dev Container, you'll also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an account on Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>.\n",
    "- Get access to Azure OpenAI. Visit <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai> and request access.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE]\n",
    "  > At the time of writing, you need to apply for access to Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource. Check out this guide on [creating a resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locate API key and endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you need to tell your `openai` library which API key to use. To find your API key, go to the \"Keys and Endpoint\" section of your Azure OpenAI resource and copy the value for \"Key 1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Keys and Endpoint resource blade in Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/media/quickstarts/endpoint.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've copied this information, let's set up the libraries to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> It's a good idea to keep your API key separate from your code. You can do this with environment variables.\n",
    "> - Set the environment variable `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to your API key in your .env file. If you've already done the earlier exercises in this course, you're all set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup configuration Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Azure OpenAI, here's how to set up the configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = AzureOpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key=os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],  \n",
    "  api_version = \"2023-10-01-preview\"\n",
    "  azure_endpoint = os.environ('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT')\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we're setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api_key`, which is your API key from the Azure Portal.\n",
    "- `api_version`, which is the API version you want to use. At the time of writing, the latest is `2023-10-01-preview`.\n",
    "- `azure_endpoint`, which is the API endpoint. You can find it in the Azure Portal next to your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> `os.environ` is a function that reads environment variables. You can use it to read variables like `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate text\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate text, use the `chat.completion` class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Complete the following: Once upon a time there was a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we create a completion object, pass in the model we want to use and the prompt, then print the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat completions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've seen how we've used `Completion` to generate text. There's also a class called `ChatCompletion` that's better for chatbots. Here's how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = AzureOpenAI(\n",
    "  azure_endpoint = os.environ('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'), \n",
    "  api_key=os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],  \n",
    "  api_version = \"2023-05-15\"\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT']\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world\"}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover more about this feature in a later chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - your first text generation app\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned how to set up and configure Azure OpenAI service, it's time to build your first text generation app. To build your app, follow these steps:\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Generate a type of text**. For example, you can generate a poem, questions for a quiz, etc.\n",
    "- **Lookup information**. You can use prompts to look for information like the following example: 'What does CORS mean in web development?'\n",

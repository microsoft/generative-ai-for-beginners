    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen throughout this curriculum, there are core concepts like prompts and even an entire field called \"prompt engineering.\" Many tools you can use, such as ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and more, let you use prompts to get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add this kind of experience to your own app, you need to understand concepts like prompts, completions, and pick a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll learn in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about the openai library and its main concepts.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Understand how to use concepts like prompt, temperature, and tokens to build a text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what a text generation app is.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Configure your app to use more or fewer tokens and also change the temperature for different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when you build an app, it has some kind of interface like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps are typical apps where you type a command and it performs a task. For example, `git` is a command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, enter text, select options, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to a command-based app where you type a command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's limited**. You can't just type any command, only the ones the app supports.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps support many languages, but by default, the app is built for a specific language, even if you can add more language support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is a text generation app different?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a text generation app, you have more flexibility; you're not limited to a set of commands or a specific input language. Instead, you can use natural language to interact with the app. Another benefit is that you're already interacting with a data source that's been trained on a huge amount of information, whereas a traditional app might be limited to what's in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can I build with a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you can build. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A chatbot**. A chatbot that answers questions about topics like your company and its products could be a great fit.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs are great at things like summarizing text, extracting insights from text, generating text like resumes, and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model you use, you can build a code assistant that helps you write code. For example, you can use a product like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to help you write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find a way to connect with an LLM, which usually means one of these two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an API. Here, you create web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use a library. Libraries help wrap the API calls and make them easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few well-known libraries for working with LLMs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**, this library makes it easy to connect to your model and send in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are libraries that work at a higher level, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain is well known and supports Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a library by Microsoft that supports C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app using openai\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can build our first app, what libraries we need, how much is required, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install openai\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE] This step is not necessary if run this notebook on Codespaces or within a Devcontainer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries out there for interacting with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. You can use many programming languages as well, like C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, and more.  \n",
    "We've chosen to use the `openai` Python library, so we'll use `pip` to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't running this notebook in a Codespaces or a Dev Container, you also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a resource and locate your API key\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, you need to do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an account on OpenAI <https://platform.openai.com/signup>.\n",
    "- Now, get your API keys <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>.\n",
    "\n",
    ">[!NOTE]\n",
    "> It's a good idea to keep your API key separate from your code. You can do this by using environment variables.\n",
    "> - Set the environment variable `OPENAI_KEY` to your API key in your .env file. If you already completed the previous exercises of this course, you are all set up.\n",
    "> - It's important to note that the API Key will only be shown once. So, make sure you copy it correctly. If it doesn't work, it's best to delete the key and generate a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup configuration OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using OpenAI, here's how you set up the configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = OpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we're setting the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api_key`, this is your API key found in the OpenAI dashboard.\n",
    "- `deployment`, this is your GPT version.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> `os.environ` is a function that reads environment variables. You can use it to read environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate text\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate text, use the `chat.completion` class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Complete the following: Once upon a time there was a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we create a completion object and pass in the model we want to use and the prompt. Then we print the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat completions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've seen how we've been using `Completion` to generate text. But there's another class called `ChatCompletion` that's better suited for chatbots. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = OpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world\"}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More on this functionality in a later chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - your first text generation app\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've learned how to set up and configure the OpenAI service, it's time to build your first text generation app. To build your app, follow these steps:\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Generate a type of text**. For example, you can generate a poem, questions for a quiz, etc.\n",
    "- **Lookup information**. You can use prompts to look for information like the following example 'What does CORS mean in web development?'.\n",

    "    filter = input(\"Filter (for example, vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free: \")\n",

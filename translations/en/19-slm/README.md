# Introduction to Small Language Models for Generative AI for Beginners  
Generative AI is an exciting area of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that can create new content. This content can include text, images, music, or even entire virtual worlds. One of the most thrilling uses of generative AI is in language models.

## What Are Small Language Models?  

A Small Language Model (SLM) is a scaled-down version of a large language model (LLM), using many of the same architectural principles and techniques but with a much smaller computational footprint.

SLMs are a type of language model designed to generate human-like text. Unlike larger models like GPT-4, SLMs are more compact and efficient, making them ideal for situations where computing resources are limited. Despite their smaller size, they can still handle a variety of tasks. Usually, SLMs are created by compressing or distilling LLMs, aiming to keep much of the original model’s functionality and language skills. This smaller size reduces complexity, making SLMs more efficient in terms of memory and computation. Even with these optimizations, SLMs can perform many natural language processing (NLP) tasks:

- Text Generation: Producing coherent and contextually relevant sentences or paragraphs.  
- Text Completion: Predicting and finishing sentences based on a prompt.  
- Translation: Converting text from one language to another.  
- Summarization: Condensing long texts into shorter, easier-to-understand summaries.  

Though there are some trade-offs in performance or depth of understanding compared to larger models.

## How Do Small Language Models Work?  
SLMs are trained on large amounts of text data. During training, they learn language patterns and structures, enabling them to generate text that is grammatically correct and contextually fitting. The training process includes:

- Data Collection: Gathering large text datasets from various sources.  
- Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data for training.  
- Training: Using machine learning algorithms to teach the model how to understand and generate text.  
- Fine-Tuning: Adjusting the model to improve performance on specific tasks.  

SLMs have been developed to meet the growing need for models that can run in resource-limited environments, like mobile devices or edge computing platforms, where full-scale LLMs are often too demanding. By focusing on efficiency, SLMs strike a balance between performance and accessibility, enabling wider use across different fields.

## Learning Objectives  

In this lesson, we aim to introduce the concept of SLMs and combine it with Microsoft Phi-3 to explore various scenarios in text content, vision, and MoE.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to answer:

- What is an SLM?  
- How do SLMs differ from LLMs?  
- What is the Microsoft Phi-3/3.5 Family?  
- How to perform inference with Microsoft Phi-3/3.5 Family?  

Ready? Let’s get started.

## The Differences Between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs)  

Both LLMs and SLMs are based on probabilistic machine learning principles and share similar architectural designs, training methods, data generation, and evaluation techniques. However, several key factors set them apart.

## Applications of Small Language Models  

SLMs are used in many areas, including:

- Chatbots: Offering customer support and engaging users conversationally.  
- Content Creation: Helping writers generate ideas or draft articles.  
- Education: Assisting students with writing or language learning.  
- Accessibility: Building tools for people with disabilities, like text-to-speech systems.  

**Size**  

A major difference between LLMs and SLMs is their scale. LLMs like ChatGPT (GPT-4) can have around 1.76 trillion parameters, while open-source SLMs like Mistral 7B have far fewer—about 7 billion parameters. This difference stems from variations in model architecture and training. For example, ChatGPT uses a self-attention mechanism within an encoder-decoder framework, whereas Mistral 7B employs sliding window attention in a decoder-only model, allowing more efficient training. These architectural differences greatly affect model complexity and performance.

**Comprehension**  

SLMs are usually optimized for specific domains, making them highly specialized but sometimes limited in broad contextual understanding across many knowledge areas. LLMs, on the other hand, aim to mimic human-like intelligence more comprehensively. Trained on vast and diverse datasets, LLMs perform well across many domains, offering greater versatility and adaptability. Therefore, LLMs are better suited for a wider range of tasks, including natural language processing and programming.

**Computing**  

Training and running LLMs require significant computational resources, often involving large GPU clusters. For instance, training a model like ChatGPT from scratch can need thousands of GPUs over long periods. SLMs, with fewer parameters, are more accessible computationally. Models like Mistral 7B can be trained and run on local machines with moderate GPU power, though training still takes several hours on multiple GPUs.

**Bias**  

Bias is a known challenge in LLMs, mainly due to the nature of their training data. These models often use raw, publicly available internet data, which may underrepresent or misrepresent certain groups, contain labeling errors, or reflect linguistic biases from dialects, regions, and grammar rules. The complexity of LLM architectures can also unintentionally amplify bias, which might go unnoticed without careful fine-tuning. SLMs, trained on more focused, domain-specific datasets, tend to be less prone to such biases, though they are not completely immune.

**Inference**  

SLMs’ smaller size gives them a big advantage in inference speed, allowing them to generate outputs efficiently on local hardware without needing extensive parallel processing. LLMs, due to their size and complexity, often require substantial parallel computing resources to achieve reasonable inference times. When many users access LLMs simultaneously, response times can slow down, especially at scale.

In summary, while LLMs and SLMs share a machine learning foundation, they differ significantly in model size, resource needs, contextual understanding, bias susceptibility, and inference speed. These differences determine their suitability for various use cases: LLMs offer versatility but are resource-heavy, while SLMs provide domain-specific efficiency with lower computational demands.

***Note: In this chapter, we will introduce SLMs using Microsoft Phi-3 / 3.5 as an example.***

## Introducing the Phi-3 / Phi-3.5 Family  

The Phi-3 / 3.5 Family mainly targets text, vision, and Agent (MoE) application scenarios:

### Phi-3 / 3.5 Instruct  

Primarily for text generation, chat completion, and content information extraction.

**Phi-3-mini**  

The 3.8B parameter language model is available on Microsoft Azure AI Studio, Hugging Face, and Ollama. Phi-3 models significantly outperform language models of similar or larger sizes on key benchmarks (see benchmark scores below; higher is better). Phi-3-mini outperforms models twice its size, while Phi-3-small and Phi-3-medium outperform larger models, including GPT-3.5.

**Phi-3-small & medium**  

With just 7B parameters, Phi-3-small beats GPT-3.5T on various language, reasoning, coding, and math benchmarks.

Phi-3-medium, with 14B parameters, continues this trend and outperforms Gemini 1.0 Pro.

**Phi-3.5-mini**  

Think of this as an upgrade to Phi-3-mini. While the parameter count remains the same, it improves multilingual support (supporting 20+ languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian) and adds stronger support for long context.

Phi-3.5-mini with 3.8B parameters outperforms language models of the same size and matches models twice its size.

### Phi-3 / 3.5 Vision  

You can think of the Phi-3/3.5 Instruct model as Phi’s ability to understand language, and Vision as giving Phi “eyes” to understand the world.

**Phi-3-Vision**  

With only 4.2B parameters, Phi-3-Vision continues the trend and outperforms larger models like Claude-3 Haiku and Gemini 1.0 Pro V on general visual reasoning, OCR, and table and diagram comprehension tasks.

**Phi-3.5-Vision**  

Phi-3.5-Vision is an upgrade to Phi-3-Vision, adding support for multiple images. Think of it as an improvement in vision: not only can it see pictures, but also videos.

Phi-3.5-Vision outperforms larger models such as Claude-3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Flash on OCR, table, and chart understanding tasks, and matches them on general visual knowledge reasoning. It supports multi-frame input, meaning it can reason over multiple images at once.

### Phi-3.5-MoE  

***Mixture of Experts (MoE)*** allows models to be pretrained with much less compute, enabling dramatic scaling of model or dataset size with the same compute budget as a dense model. Specifically, a MoE model can reach the same quality as its dense counterpart much faster during pretraining.

Phi-3.5-MoE consists of 16 expert modules, each with 3.8B parameters. Phi-3.5-MoE, with only 6.6B active parameters, achieves reasoning, language understanding, and math capabilities comparable to much larger models.

We can use the Phi-3/3.5 Family models in different scenarios. Unlike LLMs, you can deploy Phi-3/3.5-mini or Phi-3/3.5-Vision on edge devices.

## How to Use Phi-3/3.5 Family Models  

We aim to use Phi-3/3.5 in various scenarios. Next, we will explore using Phi-3/3.5 based on different use cases.

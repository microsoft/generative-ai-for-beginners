    "\n",
    "**Use quality data**. If you want to build a classifier or have the model follow a pattern, make sure you provide enough examples. Always check your examples for errors â€” the model is usually smart enough to ignore simple spelling mistakes and still respond, but it might also think you did it on purpose, which can affect its answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check your settings.** The temperature and top_p settings control how random or predictable the model's responses are. If you want a response with only one correct answer, set these lower. If you want more varied responses, set them higher. The most common mistake people make with these settings is thinking they control \"cleverness\" or \"creativity.\"\n",

In contrast, humans can usually handle a new language task with just a few examples or simple instructionsâ€”something current NLP systems still find difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that making language models larger greatly boosts their ability to perform new tasks with little or no task-specific data, sometimes even matching the performance of previous state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. \n",

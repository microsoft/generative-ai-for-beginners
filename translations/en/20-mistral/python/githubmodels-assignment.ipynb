    "This model improves on the original Mistral Large by offering:\n",
    "- A larger context window – 128k compared to 32k\n",
    "- Better results on math and coding tasks – 76.9% average accuracy versus 60.4%\n",
    "- Enhanced multilingual capabilities – supported languages include: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to these features, Mistral Large is especially strong at:\n",
    "- *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)* – the expanded context window makes it ideal for this\n",
    "- *Function Calling* – the model supports native function calling, enabling integration with external tools and APIs. These calls can be made either in parallel or sequentially, one after another.\n",
    "- *Code Generation* – the model performs exceptionally well when generating code in Python, Java, TypeScript, and C++.\n"
